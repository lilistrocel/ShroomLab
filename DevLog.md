# ShroomLab Development Log

## Project Overview
**Goal**: Create a modular API Hub and central management system for mushroom farm operations

### Core Features
- **IoT & Sensor Control**: Monitor and control farm sensors via APIs
- **Production Management**: Track inputs, outputs, and processes
- **Business Operations**: HR, Finance, Delivery, Reports, Dashboards

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Node.js web interface
- **Backend**: Python API services
- **Database**: MySQL (primary)
- **Additional**: Redis (caching), InfluxDB (time-series data), Docker (containerization)

## Architecture Recommendations

### Improved Stack Suggestions:
1. **Database Layer**:
   - **MySQL**: Primary relational data (users, farm configs, business data)
   - **InfluxDB**: Time-series sensor data (temperature, humidity, CO2, etc.)
   - **Redis**: Caching and session management

2. **Backend Services** (Python):
   - **FastAPI**: Main API gateway and business logic
   - **Celery**: Background tasks and scheduled jobs
   - **WebSocket**: Real-time sensor data streaming

3. **Frontend** (Node.js):
   - **React/Next.js**: Modern web interface
   - **Socket.io**: Real-time data visualization
   - **Chart.js/D3.js**: Dashboards and reports

4. **Infrastructure**:
   - **Docker**: Containerized services
   - **RabbitMQ/Redis**: Message queuing for IoT communications
   - **Nginx**: Reverse proxy and load balancing
