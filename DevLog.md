# ShroomLab Development Log

## Project Overview
**Goal**: Create a modular API Hub and central management system for mushroom farm operations

### Core Features
- **IoT & Sensor Control**: Monitor and control farm sensors via APIs
- **Production Management**: Track inputs, outputs, and processes
- **Business Operations**: HR, Finance, Delivery, Reports, Dashboards
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live data visualization and alerts

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: Node.js web interface
- **Backend**: Python API services
- **Database**: MySQL (primary)
- **Additional**: Redis (caching), InfluxDB (time-series data), Docker (containerization)

## Architecture Recommendations

### Improved Stack Suggestions:
1. **Database Layer**:
   - **MySQL**: Primary relational data (users, farm configs, business data)
   - **InfluxDB**: Time-series sensor data (temperature, humidity, CO2, etc.)
   - **Redis**: Caching and session management

2. **Backend Services** (Python):
   - **FastAPI**: Main API gateway and business logic
   - **Celery**: Background tasks and scheduled jobs
   - **WebSocket**: Real-time sensor data streaming

3. **Frontend** (Node.js):
   - **React/Next.js**: Modern web interface
   - **Socket.io**: Real-time data visualization
   - **Chart.js/D3.js**: Dashboards and reports

4. **Infrastructure**:
   - **Docker**: Containerized services
   - **RabbitMQ/Redis**: Message queuing for IoT communications
   - **Nginx**: Reverse proxy and load balancing

## Development Phases

## Current Status
**Date**: Initial Project Setup
**Phase**: Phase 1 - Foundation & Setup
**Progress**: 95%

### Today's Tasks:
1. ✅ Created DevLog for tracking progress
2. ✅ Design project structure
3. ✅ Set up development environment (Docker Compose)
4. ✅ Create database schema design
5. ✅ Create API Gateway service with FastAPI
6. ✅ Implement authentication system with JWT
7. ✅ Create user management and farm management APIs
8. ✅ Set up WebSocket for real-time communications
9. ✅ Create Windows development script (start.bat)
10. ✅ Create Ubuntu production deployment script (deploy-ubuntu.sh)
11. ✅ Update documentation for cross-platform support

### Notes:
- Considering microservices architecture for scalability
- Need to research specific mushroom farm sensor types and requirements
- Should plan for multi-farm support in the future
- Development environment supports Windows (using start.bat)
- Production deployment automated for Ubuntu (using deploy-ubuntu.sh)
- Cross-platform Docker setup ensures consistency

### Next Steps:
1. Create project directory structure
2. Design database schema
3. Set up Docker development environment
4. Create basic API endpoints
